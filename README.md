* A buffer of 3 seats and/or one row is required in between reservation IDs
 
* Input files will be human-readable text. 

Sample command line input:
```
R001 2 
R002 4 
R003 4 
R004 3
```

Sample command line output:
```
R001 I1,I2
R002 F16,F17,F18,F19 
R003 A1,A2,A3,A4 
R004 J4,J5,J6
```

where `R###` is the reservation identifier and `A##-J##` is a seat.
